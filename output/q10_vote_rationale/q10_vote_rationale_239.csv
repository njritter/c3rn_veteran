"America has seen progress in recreational cannabis throughout California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Massachusetts and Illinois. Crimes involving cannabis are down. The economic progress of these areas has climbed from the taxes on cannabis. It is safer to know where you are getting the cannabis from, rather than something from the street that could be laced. The challenge for NJ is to tax it fairly. Such as California, who taxes a modest 10% which makes it cheaper, safer and better than street cannabis.","1","0.42"

"Cannabis has a very high therapeutic index, which means there’s very little, if any, chance of an overdose. It is non-addictive and less dangerous than other legal drugs, such as alcohol and tobacco. It would bring in more tax revenue to the state and it would be safer to consume if it’s legalized (lower risk of it being laced with other drugs that could be potentially fatal). There is inconclusive evidence that marijuana is a gateway drug and it would be safer for people to consume it legally. It’s obscene that people are jailed for non violent crimes of possession or use of marijuana, which leads to overcrowding of our prisons. Not to mention the disproportionately that black people are arrested for drug charges. ","1","0.42"

"Cannabis is natural and should be legal.","1","0.42"
"Cannabis is no worse than alcohol (IMO it’s actual less dangerous than alcohol usage). If alcohol and cigarettes are legal and being taxed so too should cannabis. In addition, the number of lives that are destroyed because of the criminalization of cannabis is far too great. The War on Drugs has resulted in far too many young people (and disproportionately people of color) being sent to prison over a victimless “crime”. ","1","0.42"

"For a number of different reasons.  Personally, I would like the option to use it recreationally.  For our society, I think it is currently policed unfairly based on the color of a person's skin.  Far too many people of color are incarcerated in comparison to white people for cannabis-related charges.  I also think by legalizing it, it will be safer to purchase and will not connect young adults with drug dealers - who could go on and offer them stronger, more addictive, more deadly drugs to purchase.   ","1","0.42"
"for adult use. bc cannabis is illegal in many us states, illegal use of the drug disproportionately affects black americans and other people of color. they are sentenced to unreasonably long jail times or high fines when caught with the drug, and often fall victim to police brutality. this does not affect white americans in the same way as they get lesser sentences (if they get sentenced to jail or even arrested at all) legalizing cannabis can help reduce the amount of black americans and poc in jail and hopefully change the way certain people view the drug.","1","0.42"

"I'm voting for it because I believe the legalization of cannabis will provide legislation to expunge wrongfully issued and harsh criminal charges, especially for minorities, create a more competitive market for medical marijuana, thus helping those using it to avoid using opioids, thereby helping to combat the opioid crisis the state (and country) is facing, as well as providing an additional source of income for the state that can help to lower or eliminate other taxes (like the gas tax) to help benefit those who reside in the state.

I think that, when weighing the consequences of marijuana use and other controlled substances, marijuana poses a lower risk. Also, I am voting for adult-use cannabis legalization because I think it may serve as a stepping stone to decriminalize marijuana usage and possession.  This, hopefully, can allow men and women who are serving outlandish mandatory minimum sentences for minimal marijuana charges, to have their records expunged. ","1","0.42"

"I am voting for Cannabis Legalization because I don’t believe it is right to put people in jail for using cannabis or dealing it. Firstly we have alcohol in this world, which is known to have actual effects of harming your health. Yet it is “socially acceptable”. So why are we allowed to drink alcohol which can eventually kill you, but can’t use cannabis? Legalizing cannabis would be good because we could actually get more research on how cannabis effects the body, etc. Cannabis use will still happen even if it’s illegal or not, so why not make it safer and legal to use cannabis? It’s a medical option for treating certain medical conditions. it only makes sense to legalize cannabis. Also cannabis is great and that is why I’m voting to legalize adult use of cannabis.

"I feel that it should be more up to the person to decide and if they get it legally it will result in similar uses like alcohol.

"I have never partaken in cannabis use, but its benefits are undeniable. Health benefits are incredible, and the option to make it widely available, without thc or otherwise, is important to the population. If the tax benefits are utilized well by New Jersey, it could truly help our infrastructure, schools, and hopefully many other areas. I also hope that legalization will retroactively help those with offenses on their records and those who are currently incarcerated. ","1","0.42"

It helped him during chemo and radiation too","1","0.42"

"I think that cannabis is a great alternative for people especially when it comes to medication for mental illness. Rather than taking a man-made drug, I would much rather take a more natural remedy which is why I would want it to be legalized. In addition, there are so many people charged with possession of weed and end up doing time longer than a person who SHOULD be in jail for committing a more heinous crime. Also because it is portrayed negatively and attached with a negative connotation. ","1","0.42"
"I think that people should be able to use it as long as they are over 21. I think there are a lot of people in prison right now for this that don’t need to be, so in the future it can lessen the strain on our prison systems.","1","0.42"
"I think there are way more benefits than people realize","1","0.42"

"I’m voting for it not only because I feel people shouldn’t be punished for using a drug that has been proven to help them but also because it’s unfair that treatment on this topic varies depending on where you are. Keeping it legal & people in jail for selling it is racist. ","1","0.42"

"Recreationally, cannabis is much safer than alcohol. Medicinally, cannabis helps control pain, seizures, muscle spasms, anxiety, and more. It is not addictive and regular users are generally more relaxed and happy. And legalizing cannabis and expunging the records of people currently or previously incarcerated for marijuana violations will be the first step in reforming our justice system that disproportionately arrests and convicts black people for these “crimes.”","1","0.42"

"There are proven benefits from the utilization of cannabis for medical needs plus you never hear about two cannabis users getting into a fight, only alcohol induced fights.

"This will make it more accessible for those suffering conditions that do not get covered by current medical use of cannabis or those who can not afford to get medical clearances. It will be good if it is monitored like alcohol so those using it recklessly will need to be accountable but overall those who have been punished for having it on their person will no longer be treated as criminals as long as they are using correctly.","1","0.42"

"We are jailing people for a ""drug"" that is no worse for you than alcohol.  Most of those people are people of color, which is wrong.  Legalizing marijuana can possibly give police something better to do with their time, rather than chasing down people with a bit of weed on them.      Additionally, cannabis could provide pain relief in lieu of using prescription pain medication that is far more harmful for people than cannabis.      It's a no brainer to legalize it.  ","1","0.42"

"While I oppose incarcerating people for marijuana usage, I also oppose outright legalization of a mind-altering drug. There will be many more people driving under the influence resulting in more accidents, injuries, and deaths. It will be harder for employers to maintain drug-free workplaces. Marijuana is not a harmless substance. Street-level product often has impurities and other substances added including ones that are far more dangerous, like PCP. Just because it is legalized doesn't mean everyone will start buying it at their local dispensary where prices are way higher.","1","0.42"
"While I personally do not agree with smoking marijuana in public where anyone can be exposed to it, I do not feel it is harmful enough for the government to ban it.
