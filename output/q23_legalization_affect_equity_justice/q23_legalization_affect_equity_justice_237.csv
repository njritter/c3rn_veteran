"As previously stated, I believe legislation can be enacted to expunge prior criminal records related to cannabis. This would be especially beneficial to minorities who were wrongfully convicted to harsher sentences compared to similar offenses committed by white individuals. However, NJ has residents who are vehemently against this, who will still socially ostracize those who use regardless of legality. While I agree with people being able to do as they please, public consumption isn't an idea I am comfortable with. If it can be limited to private residence and private businesses, I feel personally and socially, legalization of cannabis will come to fruition and greater acceptance than if complete public consumption is allowed.","1","0.42"
"As time passed and stigmas are mitigated and it becomes the norm, I would imagine it has some degree of impact positively on social equity. If it’s low income communities being affected the worst by these financial burdens for minimal possession, they are unable to sustain a consistent life and financial flow.  As for restorative justice, I think the biggest reason it will happen is because of the promises made by politicians. I have little faith that politics will truly undo the wrongs committed by these victims, but I have faith that the cultures of the future general public will take advantage of all the many marketing tactics to put out what the public (specifically the victims) need. Not because of the “robust and competitive” nature the free market brings that’s bullshit. But because I do believe it would be the right thing to do. And I’d be willing to bet there’s at least one good person out there willing to continue seeking it out","1","0.42"

THAT IS, THEY HAVE CREATED A FAKE PROBLEM FOR YOU TO ""SOLVE"" WHILE ACTUALLY BENEFITTING THE MINORITY IN GOVERNMENT. P.S. THIS SURVEY IS EXTRREMELY BIASED TOWARD LEGALIZATION.

I fear that the powers that be will continue to find new ways to maintain social inequity, despite legalization. ","1","0.42"
"I believe that people will start seeing the benefits of cannabis and finally move past the ""reefer madness"" scare tactic that has lasted since its arrival. The plant (IT IS JUST A PLANT) offers various forms of healing. Many recreational users enjoy legal cannabis because it alleviates personal issues (medical or otherwise) that the MEDICAL cannabis system deems to NOT be an issue. Plus, records should be expunged and those who were convicted and expunged should be offered jobs FIRST. This way they contribute to society and the overall economic progress that this country desperately needs after this absolutely 100% horrid presidency of the past FOUR years.","1","0.42"

"I don’t agree with going back in time. Using time & money on expunging old cases if a person broke the law back then it is on them to use their own money to pay for expungements. Money needs to be used on K-9’s that will have to be retired & new ones implemented.","1","0.42"

"I generally do not subscribe to the notion that equity (equally of outcome) is something which is obtainable. We should strive for equality of opportunity as often well intentioned policies that are put in place in order to achieve equity have many negative tangential effects that can lead to less equality of outcome. That being said, I believe that legalization of marijuana will allow for more equality of opportunity in which people can live their best lives and achieve their best possible outcomes (although all outcomes may not be equal).","1","0.42"
"I have mixed feelings here. People who were convicted of crimes still broke the law. I think that larger crimes should not be expunged but minor possession convictions should be expunged. ","1","0.42"

"I think it’ll have a postive effect on NJ","1","0.42"
"I think it’sa step towards equity but also has to be just the first step - we also need to recount records, provide reparations for those incarcerated for non-violent cannibas offenses and provide equal opportunities for those as well","1","0.42"
"I think legalization is a step in the right direction and should be followed by expunging the records of those convicted only of cannabis related crimes.","1","0.42"
"I think legalized cannabis is a good first step in reversing the awful effects created by the war on drugs. The war on drugs was just another way for cops to target minorities to keep them disproportionately jailed away from society. So if prior convictions related to non violent drug charges are expunged, then that will allow these people a better chance at finding their place in society again. We need to focus more on restorative justice than the punitive system we have in place now. Legalizing cannabis is definitely a good first step in improving social equity in NJ, but more steps need to be taken to right the wrongs of the war on drugs. ","1","0.42"
"I think our state will see a huge decrease in felonies and convictions in all races.","1","0.42"
"I think social equity and restorative justice will be affected as marijuana alters an individual’s mind and brain. This leads to them not being able to physical responsibility for what they say and the way they act. I think marijuana is a very dangerous chemical. ","1","0.42"

"I think that it will positively impact those effects from it.","1","0.42"
"I think that legalizing cannabis is positive.  I don't necessarily believe that we should erase all fault for prior convictions because at the time they were performing an illegal action. Moving forward after legalization, I feel social equity is necessary","1","0.42"
"I think that people who have been traditionally underrepresented and marginalized are the ones that get convicted on marijuana charges. By making cannabis legal, you positively impact marginalized communities. ","1","0.42"
"I think that the stigma on people that use cannabis will be nullified and ultimately will take away the stereotypes associated with the people who do partake in the use of cannabis.","1","0.42"

"I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are far weightier topics affecting social equity. Any positive steps forward will be beneficial ","1","0.42"
"I think this will take time but eventually I would hope that the stigma around marijuana use and violence lessens. I think this stigma arises from it being a category one drug and often associated with Black people who are also given harsher punishments because of marijuana and their race.","1","0.42"
"i think this would help african americans from gettifn arrested on small possession charges as well as give black people already convicted a better chance to getting out and having help starting a new life ","1","0.42"
"I would hope by legalizing marijuana it will definitely help with small time offenders in their release and their criminal record. ","1","0.42"
"I would hope that those who are being appropriate and mature about what they do with cannabis will be treated the same as those with alcohol, and in that sense the same treatment applied to those who Misuse alcohol  that may misuse cannabis. ","1","0.42"
"I would like to believe that restorative justice will be implemented if adult-use cannabis is legalized in New Jersey, but I am not confident that it will. I would expect that going forward, no further criminal proceedings against citizens will occur for recreational use. I cannot count on NJ to clear out past offenses given the state's prior record with everything else.","1","0.42"

"If it is legalized I believe it will restore justice because people who are in jail because of marijuana will be able to recieve justice and sentences can be lessened.","1","0.42"
"If it is legalized. There has to be a task force set up to go back and help people who have been convicted of cannabis possession that is now legalized. You can’t continue to punish someone for a crime that is no longer illegal. This needs to include removing those convictions from there records, so they no longer have to say they have been convicted of a crime on job interviews, credit applications and have their voting rights restored. Also this needs to include getting rid of any fines or penalties these individuals still have to pay to gain their freedom. There should also be task force set up to repay fines to people who have had to pay penalties based on cannabis convictions.","1","0.42"
"If it’s made legal to many people will be running around high a lot more accidents ","1","0.42"
"If legalizing is passed they should allow people to get marijuana. People who are arrested prior to passing need to do there time ","1","0.42"
"Im hoping to end the stigma around Marijuana and maybe open public eyes to medicinal products not yet widely considered. I pray that those affected by the drug war will get some kind of equity and the government will pay back what they took from these people. ","1","0.42"

"It is my hope that if adult-use cannabis is legalized in New Jersey, we will also see greater social equity and restorative justice practices. Due to historic societal view and understanding of cannabis as ""the gateway drug""/the war on drugs, the legalization of adult-use cannabis will take some time to be widely accepted - especially by the older, more conservative demographic. Due to this, there is a chance that social equity and restorative justice will not be immediately improved post-legalization.","1","0.42"
