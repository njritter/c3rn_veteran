"‚Ä¢ More and more people will use cannabis   ‚Ä¢ Cannibis legalization will usher in Americas new version of ""big tobacco""    ‚Ä¢ Prices of marijuana will increase and those who TRULY need it will suffer vs people who use it just to get high.   ‚Ä¢ Drug cartels and the black market will continue to function under the legalization of marijuana and will benefit.   ‚Ä¢ The number of fatal accidents with drivers testing positive for marijuana use has sky rocketed.     I am a medical marijuana patient, I do use it recreationally but it is going to do more harm then it does good and that is my personal opinion as well as factual studies that have proven legalization brings problems.

"As a medical patient I find access awesome but some of the dispensaries are more strict than others. SERA naturals for example is like fort nox and I feel as though I'm being treated like a criminal in there. Also, some of the workers at dispensaries (NETA) get personally offended if you don't like their product even if it is objectively not of good quality. It takes a bit to find places that have all around great quality products and selection. So far Revolutionary Clinics is my favorite but their edible selection isn't great.","1","0.11"

"As with any ingested substance that affects the body, there are risks for abuse and disuse, along with potential unintended social side effects, but when compared to other socially acceptable substances - notably alcohol - it is far less risky.  If nothing else, legalization should open up the doors for deep medical research which will hopefully provide effective alternatives to pharmaceuticals for many people.","1","0.11"

"I believe that the legalization of cannabis is great for economic growth and the overall health and stature of humans and animals alike. Cannabis can replace thousands of harmful products, foods, textiles and medicines and could really start the frontier of the next age.

"I have mixed feeling about the legalization of cannabis. I think it should be used for medicinal purposes and that people who use it recreationally should use it responsibly.

If/when it becomes legal on that level, I hope that people with marijuana charges will be helped.","1","0.11"

"I think it's fine under a real doctor's care, where you're monitored. But how many are? I certainly don't agree with it being legalized for recreation. People who smoke know where or how to get it. Why have ""New year's Eve"" 24/7, 365. You know what I mean: on NYE EVERYONE thinks he's an expert drinker. As a recovering alcoholic I call it ""Amateur night."" Same for pot. People who'd never tried it might stampede and how many will be able to handle ""high?""","1","0.11"
"I think it's good, but I don't want to see it get out of control where people are just smoking it walking down the street.  Also, I have a teen heading to college that I'm for so I want her to be focused.  I know people who smoke and vape it all day long, and I don't think that's good.","1","0.11"

I don't mind if they also use cannabis, but I would like to have more medicinal strains available and more consistency in the products.

Otherwise, your attempt at progression is futile. Also, advertising the differences between medical and recreational marijuana will be crucial. Other states have seen patterns of medical users turning their reliance solely to recreational dispensaries due to an ease of convenience - but is the weed the same? The benefits of legalization will be realized in time and I wonder in 15 years if legislators will look back and wonder why they didn't allow the ball to get rolling faster...maybe the other issues plaguing the state could've been solved via a tangential relationship we don't even understand yet.","1","0.11"

Before a business can be created they must go to the town and say how they will provide some type of community outreach by doing a service or some number of profits to this nonprofit organization. The cost of opening a cannabis business in MA is about $40,000 minimum. The cost than rise astronomically based on location testing cost for the rec. Or if you a potential cultivator it is maybe 45k total. When a normal small business costs 30k. (AARP) You than would need to ask a bank for a loan but none would give you the loans since they are still have to follow federal law. But than the town itself can charge a tax because you are growing, in addition to the state tax when you sell to a dispensary. So if all those criteria are met you than can maybe open up and you than need to get the towns approval by supporting a non-profit they like. It's not worth it to open up a business. So community outreach needs to be removed. This then is that even the labs that test for rec have to do this as well. ","1","0.11"

The current state of cannabis laws in this country (i.e. the fact that it is still referred to a marijuana, a word chosen to feed racist viewpoints, in law books) are appalling and shameful.
