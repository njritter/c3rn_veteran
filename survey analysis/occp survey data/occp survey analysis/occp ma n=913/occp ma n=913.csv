Before a business can be created they must go to the town and say how they will provide some type of community outreach by doing a service or some number of profits to this nonprofit organization. The cost of opening a cannabis business in MA is about $40,000 minimum. The cost than rise astronomically based on location testing cost for the rec. Or if you a potential cultivator it is maybe 45k total. When a normal small business costs 30k. (AARP) You than would need to ask a bank for a loan but none would give you the loans since they are still have to follow federal law. But than the town itself can charge a tax because you are growing, in addition to the state tax when you sell to a dispensary. So if all those criteria are met you than can maybe open up and you than need to get the towns approval by supporting a non-profit they like. It's not worth it to open up a business. So community outreach needs to be removed. This then is that even the labs that test for rec have to do this as well.
