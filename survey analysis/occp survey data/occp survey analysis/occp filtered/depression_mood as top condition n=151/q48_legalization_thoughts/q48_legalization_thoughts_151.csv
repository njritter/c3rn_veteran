"Black communities have been systematically targeted through historic illegal cannabis. Because of this, legalization has a social justice component that is relevant and important. I believe this is why it stayed illegal and punishment were bias between black and white communities. Post civil rights movement it was used as a systematic tool of oppression. ","1","0.66"

"Cannabis and Hemp are both very powerful resources that have been used for healing bodies and building houses throughout history. I am cautiously optimistic to see the government regulations of this plant come into the spotlight over the last few years. ","1","0.66"
"Cannabis is medicine. Cannabis should be available to anyone. There are some many helpful uses and so many variations of cannabis that making it hard to access is criminal by those that support and impose those laws.","1","0.66"
"Cannabis legalization and decriminalization across the country is long overdue. We need to stop locking up people of color over a plant and start generating tax revenue and open access to medical patients across the board.  ","1","0.66"
"Cannabis needs to be legalized in medical and recreational forms. Not only will the ill benefit from this, but an average citizen will as well. Cannabis as it is well know in The Community, is a harmless substance that is only illegal because of racism that occurred in the early days of America.     In other words Legalize It!","1","0.66"
"Change the nomenclature, pot industry must rebrand if it ever wants to be truly legitimate. Keep recreational/medical separate units. I hope to god mj does not go down some big pharma path, but we must do something about the culture of weed (the names, the stereotypes) not overshadowing the medicinal benefits  that has helped countless people. I don't want to buy my cancer ridden grandma something called thunderfuck weed, can we call it like level 3, or chemo-easer or something not so blatant?! Also: DOJ-stay the FUCK out of this and go after the opioid crisis. I'm tired of seeing people OD on the street every single day. I'm tired of the needles, the nodding off in the middle of traffic, the sight of small children sitting alone in a car for hours while their parents are utter zombies. FIX THAT SHIT.  BEFORE YOU GO AFTER MOTHER NATURE.","1","0.66"
"Corruption from government and pharmaceutical companies is the biggest impediment to legalization and public perception regarding its use.","1","0.66"

"I am overjoyed about it, most definitely. It helps with some of the previous anxiety I'd feel while smoking. :)  But now, even though I live in a state where it's legal, I still had to take an employment drug test. This contradiction is very high stress and unnecessary and is the only thing that stops me from being an entirely 'out' cannabis user. ","1","0.66"
"I am very pleased to see recreational marijuana legalized in my lifetime.","1","0.66"
"I am worried about people driving stoned. ","1","0.66"
"I believe it is long overdue","1","0.66"
"I believe it should be legalized at a federal level, for personal use and cultivation. With similar regulations as alcohol.","1","0.66"
"I believe that the legalization of cannabis is great for economic growth and the overall health and stature of humans and animals alike. Cannabis can replace thousands of harmful products, foods, textiles and medicines and could really start the frontier of the next age. I believe if it was legalized completely all around the world that we would see a dramatic decrease in crimes and just overall problems in general. Possibly making the world a happier place to inhabit.","1","0.66"
"I believe the process is fueled by good intentions, that cannabis has a huge medical potential, and that the cannabis ""revolution"", if you will, is only just beginning. The fact that it's illegal in the first place is a huge blemish on America (as it's original illegalization/spread of the ""reefer madness"" stigma were both rooted in racism against Mexicans) and proof that our country has been corrupt for at least a century. Cannabis is awesome, America kind of sucks.","1","0.66"
"I believe whole heartedly that Cannabis should be 100% legal and the fact that it is a Schedule 1 drug is the most ridiculous thing in the world. ","1","0.66"
"I disagree with many of the the stances the government takes on social issues, the war on drugs is no exception.","1","0.66"
"I don't think cannabis is very significant to people, except to 1) people who need it for health reasons, and to 2) the bigots who want to put people in prison for it. Everyone in the middle seems to equate it either with beer or crack.","1","0.66"

"I support it ","1","0.66"
"I think it's fine under a real doctor's care, where you're monitored. But how many are? I certainly don't agree with it being legalized for recreation. People who smoke know where or how to get it. Why have ""New year's Eve"" 24/7, 365. You know what I mean: on NYE EVERYONE thinks he's an expert drinker. As a recovering alcoholic I call it ""Amateur night."" Same for pot. People who'd never tried it might stampede and how many will be able to handle ""high?""","1","0.66"

"It's insane that cannabis is illegal. Prohibition is a terrible policy for almost anything, but especially something that is either benign or beneficial as cannabis is. Legalization needs to happen so that innocent people stop being punished and so that use of a relatively harmless substance stops being a way for private prisons to profit off of what is essentially slave labor.     Not to mention giant pharmaceutical companies pushing meds, opioid epidemic destroying communities and fammilies, alcohol abuse affecting quality of life/public safety, etc. The list goes on forever and I'm sure you've heard it all.     Bottom line, cannabis should never have been outlawed and the fact that it can't even be studied is a travesty. ","1","0.66"

"It is about time","1","0.66"
"It is essential to provide access for a multitude of reasons, especially medical. I most likely wouldn't have been kicked out of high school for possession of a quarter gram. Legalization will hopefully reduce stigma and redirect law enforcement efforts to more important issues.","1","0.66"
"It is extremely important to me that all states legalize medicinal use of cannabis.","1","0.66"
"It is safer than alcohol! Taxation, education, and regulation are the key. It will reduce the burden on the legal system for non-violent crimes.   When consumed as edibles or vaporized flower, there seems to be almost no negative health impacts.    LEGALIZE! ","1","0.66"

"Too little, too late.  Cannabis prohibition should never have happened.  The damage to the public health has been incalculable.  Removing these vital nutrients from the public diet has led to increased incidence of cancer, diabetes, obesity, neurological and emotional problems, etc., as well as the abuse of cannabis by a misinformed populace.
