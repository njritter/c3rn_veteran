"As with any ingested substance that affects the body, there are risks for abuse and disuse, along with potential unintended social side effects, but when compared to other socially acceptable substances - notably alcohol - it is far less risky.  If nothing else, legalization should open up the doors for deep medical research which will hopefully provide effective alternatives to pharmaceuticals for many people.","1","0.37"

I'm moving to New Jersey next month, where I'll have to see a local doctor for at least one year before I can even get attempt to get registered for medical marijuana use.

I still wish workplace drug testing was figured out, cannibis users are discriminated against unfairly while alcohol drinkers are not.

There are many more that cause ""the high"" but this one weed that made rope for our Navy seems to be of great interest to the government.

"That the unintentional barriers that were put up in the legislation, that prohibits business from being created. first being in regards to community outreach. Before a business can be created they must go to the town and say how they will provide some type of community outreach by doing a service or some number of profits to this nonprofit organization. The cost of opening a cannabis business in MA is about $40,000 minimum. The cost than rise astronomically based on location testing cost for the rec. Or if you a potential cultivator it is maybe 45k total. When a normal small business costs 30k. (AARP) You than would need to ask a bank for a loan but none would give you the loans since they are still have to follow federal law. But than the town itself can charge a tax because you are growing, in addition to the state tax when you sell to a dispensary. So if all those criteria are met you than can maybe open up and you than need to get the towns approval by supporting a non-profit they like. It's not worth it to open up a business. So community outreach needs to be removed. This then is that even the labs that test for rec have to do this as well. ","1","0.37"

"The fact that it is not legal for consumption is insulting to every law-abiding adult who wants to use this plant. It is becoming ever-increasingly known that hypocrisy, misinformation, and prejudice were the driving factors behind the illegality surrounding this simple, ancient plant. If we expect to give any credence to the idea that we are enlightened and learned, then we must allow full legalization to happen. The current state of cannabis laws in this country (i.e. the fact that it is still referred to a marijuana, a word chosen to feed racist viewpoints, in law books) are appalling and shameful. Additionally, that the CCC is refusing to allow the adult-use market to open is unacceptable. On top of it, they show clear bias to known companies who have questionable relationships to the Department of Public Health and other regulatory entities.
