"100% agree in medical use, want to see it legal for medical at the Federal level.  If it is legal for recreational use, users need to be at least 25 as it seems to have negative side effects more on a developing brain.  It is a lot safer than alcohol, but especially with a younger brain, it is not innocuous. ","1","0.36"

"As a medical patient I find access awesome but some of the dispensaries are more strict than others. SERA naturals for example is like fort nox and I feel as though I'm being treated like a criminal in there. Also, some of the workers at dispensaries (NETA) get personally offended if you don't like their product even if it is objectively not of good quality. It takes a bit to find places that have all around great quality products and selection. So far Revolutionary Clinics is my favorite but their edible selection isn't great.","1","0.36"

"As a Veteran with PTSD in a state where it isn't legal, I have to watch friends die due to opioid addictions rather than allow them to smoke a plant. Where is the logic in that? I don't smoke to get ""high"", I smoke to get ""normal"".  I am off of over 15 drugs with cannabis and I can be a father. Where on the ""legal"" drugs I was a zombie","1","0.36"
"As with any ingested substance that affects the body, there are risks for abuse and disuse, along with potential unintended social side effects, but when compared to other socially acceptable substances - notably alcohol - it is far less risky.  If nothing else, legalization should open up the doors for deep medical research which will hopefully provide effective alternatives to pharmaceuticals for many people.","1","0.36"
"Big supporter especially in the age of opioid abuse and the reluctance of medical providers to prescribe opioid for real, actual and accute every day pain","1","0.36"
"Black communities have been systematically targeted through historic illegal cannabis. Because of this, legalization has a social justice component that is relevant and important. I believe this is why it stayed illegal and punishment were bias between black and white communities. Post civil rights movement it was used as a systematic tool of oppression. ","1","0.36"

"Cannabis needs to be legalized in medical and recreational forms. Not only will the ill benefit from this, but an average citizen will as well. Cannabis as it is well know in The Community, is a harmless substance that is only illegal because of racism that occurred in the early days of America.     In other words Legalize It!","1","0.36"

"Change the nomenclature, pot industry must rebrand if it ever wants to be truly legitimate. Keep recreational/medical separate units. I hope to god mj does not go down some big pharma path, but we must do something about the culture of weed (the names, the stereotypes) not overshadowing the medicinal benefits  that has helped countless people. I don't want to buy my cancer ridden grandma something called thunderfuck weed, can we call it like level 3, or chemo-easer or something not so blatant?! Also: DOJ-stay the FUCK out of this and go after the opioid crisis. I'm tired of seeing people OD on the street every single day. I'm tired of the needles, the nodding off in the middle of traffic, the sight of small children sitting alone in a car for hours while their parents are utter zombies. FIX THAT SHIT.

Give me cannabis take away the pills and the Nephrologist..my results are normal, I'm feeling healthier. Imagine that.. I feel also crime may be down, dealers maybe off the street less synthetic drugs , less deaths less ER visits less buses being used for senseless deaths or near deaths. I work in and Emergency Deptment we see what these other drugs do. Use to help get us out of the deficit,more and more people are smoking than drinking.

"I've really suffered after moving from a place where I could legally access cannabis with a medical card to a place where it is criminalized and inaccessible. Additionally I no longer qualify for medicaid in this new state. Needless to say, my access to medical care and treatment has gone down considerably. Not only am I unable to get mental health care, I'm unable to properly self-medicate without legal dispensaries and strain specificity.    Criminalization of is a structural determinant of health. Given all the intersecting issues (mass incarceration, parental stress/child maltreatment, opioid epidemic) related to cannabis legalization, I think it's absurd that research is being limited on something with such incredible capacity to reduce health disparities. Legalizing cannabis would help individuals, families, communities, businesses, and health care systems. It's time for cannabis to be formally integrated into comprehensive, whole person health care.","1","0.36"

"I think that it will help many people, and harm a few.  However, ultimately, individuals who are helped or harmed must take personal responsibility for their own decisions.  Just as there are people who misuse alcohol, there will be people who misuse pot.  I expect most of the people who misuse pot to fall in to one of two categories:  1. People who already misuse it.  2. People who already misuse other drugs (alcohol and prescriptions included)  If a large number of people get a quality of life improvement, at the expense of indulging people who are already using far more dangerous drugs, I see it as a net benefit.  State resources should be spent on education and rehabilitation, rather than a futile attempt at prohibition.","1","0.36"

"It's insane that cannabis is illegal. Prohibition is a terrible policy for almost anything, but especially something that is either benign or beneficial as cannabis is. Legalization needs to happen so that innocent people stop being punished and so that use of a relatively harmless substance stops being a way for private prisons to profit off of what is essentially slave labor.     Not to mention giant pharmaceutical companies pushing meds, opioid epidemic destroying communities and fammilies, alcohol abuse affecting quality of life/public safety, etc. The list goes on forever and I'm sure you've heard it all.     Bottom line, cannabis should never have been outlawed and the fact that it can't even be studied is a travesty. ","1","0.36"
