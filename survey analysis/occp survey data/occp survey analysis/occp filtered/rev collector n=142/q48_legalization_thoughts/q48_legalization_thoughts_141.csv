"I honestly do not feel the need for it. It should be treated medically. And I also think that it should not be sold at the same facilities that medical marijuana was sold at. Only because I feel that if you need this medically . I think that it should be under some form of a HIPAA regulation. The people that want to use recreational marijuana should not be able to purchase it at a dispensary that's used for medical purposes they should be kept separate for confidentiality purposes. Most of these people are just not going there to smoke marijuana they are going there for a reason due to a medical condition","1","0.71"

"I think it’s a great thing to do for the state. The amount of money that’ll be brought in all due to legalization! Instead of raising our taxes they should make enough to give us all some money back! Just look at California and how they did it and the annual revenue the state has received since legalization! New schools, Fix our roads, so many things and 99.9% good things! So I say it’s the start of a new era of wonderful things to come!","1","0.71"

"It's been too long coming as the prohibition was put into place by a combination of falsehoods, ignorance, racism, and the economic interests of the alcohol industry. It should have happened during the Carter Administration, but unfortunately, Keith Stroup opened his mouth and disclosed that some people in the White House smoked it and so the WH squashed the plans to attempt legalization. Nixon's ""Schafer Commission""called for decriminalization in 1972"" but that wasn't the conclusion the WH wanted, so they ignored it. ","1","0.71"

"Pro, however I am concerned about the racial implications in legalization. For example, thousands of black and brown people are in prison in Massachusetts for minir drug offenses, but have yet to be released regardless of the legal status of marijuana. While it does have medical benefits which I absolutely benefit from, I am more concerned about the implications for disenfranchised communities","1","0.71"
