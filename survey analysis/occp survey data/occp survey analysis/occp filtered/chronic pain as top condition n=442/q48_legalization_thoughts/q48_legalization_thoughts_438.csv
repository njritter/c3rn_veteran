"‚Ä¢ More and more people will use cannabis   ‚Ä¢ Cannibis legalization will usher in Americas new version of ""big tobacco""    ‚Ä¢ Prices of marijuana will increase and those who TRULY need it will suffer vs people who use it just to get high.   ‚Ä¢ Drug cartels and the black market will continue to function under the legalization of marijuana and will benefit.   ‚Ä¢ The number of fatal accidents with drivers testing positive for marijuana use has sky rocketed.     I am a medical marijuana patient, I do use it recreationally but it is going to do more harm then it does good and that is my personal opinion as well as factual studies that have proven legalization brings problems.

"As a medical patient I find access awesome but some of the dispensaries are more strict than others. SERA naturals for example is like fort nox and I feel as though I'm being treated like a criminal in there. Also, some of the workers at dispensaries (NETA) get personally offended if you don't like their product even if it is objectively not of good quality. It takes a bit to find places that have all around great quality products and selection. So far Revolutionary Clinics is my favorite but their edible selection isn't great.","1","0.23"

Recreational users pretending to be medical patients have shifted the products available towards only high THC products and those aren't always the best products for medical patients. I rarely see products with known cannabinoids and terpenes that have been shown to reduce inflammation and nerve pain. I don't mind if they also use cannabis, but I would like to have more medicinal strains available and more consistency in the products. The wait times and process are also ridiculously long because of the additional people. If we are going to say it is a medicine it needs to be treated as one, but we can also acknowledge that some strains are more for recreational use and others are for medicinal use.   ","1","0.23"

The opioid crisis is not due to Doctors.  Oxycodone has been around for a long time as Percocet and Percodan.  Oxyir and OxyContin came into play because Morphine had become so stigmatized.  Putting heroin addicts on methadone is asinine.  Medical Marajuana advocates need accolades.  I have never seen anyone overdose on marajuana.

"Open Cannabis Consumer and Patient Survey 09/30/2018 Sunday 7:08pm    In 2014 we legalized consumption of cannabis in Oregon. We additionally tried to legalize a utopian bill in 2010 [I am pretty sure but it might have been 2012]. As a tree hugging Libertarian I fully endorse cannabis and hemp legalization on all levels.    Essentially I am a freedom fighter for those that believe that cannabis is a world/earth derived/plant based medicine/consumer product that should be provided by the farmers of the planet and should be legalized, not only nationally [the USof A] but by the world at large.    I apologize for acting like a US citizen [even though I am one], and the remarks that are created from that reality, but I also want you all to remember that these statements only come from being this free as a society that is this large.    Think about that, if you can.    Cannabis freedom will set the world on a new path.    Sincerely,  Nathaniel Grant Wygethrin [previously Nathaniel Wingate Grant]","1","0.23"

"Recreational legal cannabis is appropriate. Medical should remain a separate category, to allow regulations that increase access to cannabis products for disabled and low income people. Higher plant allowances for patients growing, continuous supply at dispensaries, paying no tax, discounts for those on Medicare, Medicaid, or other financial assistances are all appropriate. The certification and card system for medical should be free; subsidized by the taxes on recreational cannabis.","1","0.23"
