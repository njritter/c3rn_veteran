"Are you using cannabis to seek relief without a high?  Or, do you have to be high to achieve medical relief?  Or, how important is getting relief without a high to you?  The dosing question should separate THC amount from CBD amount because the total number of cannabinoids is misleading. For example, my daily use is 100mg total, 80CBD 20THC. This put me in high usage category but I don't get high.   A question on how knowledgable friends and family are about cannabis would give a broader understanding of market knowledge.   Where would you prefer to gain knowledge about cannabis could reveal a need for unrealized sources?  Asking more specific questions on pricing of products would reveal the how wide the price range is in the market, i.e. price per mg of each method used. ","1","0.24"
