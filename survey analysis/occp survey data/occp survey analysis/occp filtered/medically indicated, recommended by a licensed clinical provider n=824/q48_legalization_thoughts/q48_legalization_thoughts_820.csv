"100% agree in medical use, want to see it legal for medical at the Federal level.  If it is legal for recreational use, users need to be at least 25 as it seems to have negative side effects more on a developing brain.

"‚Ä¢ More and more people will use cannabis   ‚Ä¢ Cannibis legalization will usher in Americas new version of ""big tobacco""    ‚Ä¢ Prices of marijuana will increase and those who TRULY need it will suffer vs people who use it just to get high.   ‚Ä¢ Drug cartels and the black market will continue to function under the legalization of marijuana and will benefit.   ‚Ä¢ The number of fatal accidents with drivers testing positive for marijuana use has sky rocketed.     I am a medical marijuana patient, I do use it recreationally but it is going to do more harm then it does good and that is my personal opinion as well as factual studies that have proven legalization brings problems.

"As a medical patient I find access awesome but some of the dispensaries are more strict than others. SERA naturals for example is like fort nox and I feel as though I'm being treated like a criminal in there. Also, some of the workers at dispensaries (NETA) get personally offended if you don't like their product even if it is objectively not of good quality. It takes a bit to find places that have all around great quality products and selection. So far Revolutionary Clinics is my favorite but their edible selection isn't great.","1","0.12"

"I've really suffered after moving from a place where I could legally access cannabis with a medical card to a place where it is criminalized and inaccessible. Additionally I no longer qualify for medicaid in this new state. Needless to say, my access to medical care and treatment has gone down considerably. Not only am I unable to get mental health care, I'm unable to properly self-medicate without legal dispensaries and strain specificity.    Criminalization of is a structural determinant of health. Given all the intersecting issues (mass incarceration, parental stress/child maltreatment, opioid epidemic) related to cannabis legalization, I think it's absurd that research is being limited on something with such incredible capacity to reduce health disparities. Legalizing cannabis would help individuals, families, communities, businesses, and health care systems. It's time for cannabis to be formally integrated into comprehensive, whole person health care.","1","0.12"

"I have mixed thoughts.  I am concerned about recreational use among the young increasing.  I am also concerned about the impact it may have on medical use due to the quality and availability of specific strains decreasing as the government controls the sale of all cannabis.  In Canada many growers jumping on the opportunity are becoming ‚Äòmass producers‚Äô, as we‚Äôve seen with other crops - this always has a negative impact on quality.  When anything becomes big business the consumer suffers - and I can see this affecting medical patients most of all.","1","0.12"

Its rediculous. People whose business plans are based on pre prohibition prices are rediculous too. Communities that opt out of voted for state measures are outright saying they prefer the black market to the legal one.

The current state of cannabis laws in this country (i.e. the fact that it is still referred to a marijuana, a word chosen to feed racist viewpoints, in law books) are appalling and shameful. Additionally, that the CCC is refusing to allow the adult-use market to open is unacceptable.
