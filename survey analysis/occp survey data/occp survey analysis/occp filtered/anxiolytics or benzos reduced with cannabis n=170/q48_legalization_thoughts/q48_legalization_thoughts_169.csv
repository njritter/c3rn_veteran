"100% agree in medical use, want to see it legal for medical at the Federal level.  If it is legal for recreational use, users need to be at least 25 as it seems to have negative side effects more on a developing brain.  It is a lot safer than alcohol, but especially with a younger brain, it is not innocuous. ","1","0.59"

"A positive turn for patients with a wide spectrum of issues. Less pharmies and more naturals! We've all seen the effects of too many pills on our neighbors, friends and family. Offer more alternatives and let people decide for themselves what works better for them and has less side effects.","1","0.59"

"As a medical patient I find access awesome but some of the dispensaries are more strict than others. SERA naturals for example is like fort nox and I feel as though I'm being treated like a criminal in there. Also, some of the workers at dispensaries (NETA) get personally offended if you don't like their product even if it is objectively not of good quality. It takes a bit to find places that have all around great quality products and selection. So far Revolutionary Clinics is my favorite but their edible selection isn't great.","1","0.59"
"As with any ingested substance that affects the body, there are risks for abuse and disuse, along with potential unintended social side effects, but when compared to other socially acceptable substances - notably alcohol - it is far less risky.  If nothing else, legalization should open up the doors for deep medical research which will hopefully provide effective alternatives to pharmaceuticals for many people.","1","0.59"
"Awesome ","1","0.59"
"Change the nomenclature, pot industry must rebrand if it ever wants to be truly legitimate. Keep recreational/medical separate units. I hope to god mj does not go down some big pharma path, but we must do something about the culture of weed (the names, the stereotypes) not overshadowing the medicinal benefits  that has helped countless people. I don't want to buy my cancer ridden grandma something called thunderfuck weed, can we call it like level 3, or chemo-easer or something not so blatant?! Also: DOJ-stay the FUCK out of this and go after the opioid crisis. I'm tired of seeing people OD on the street every single day. I'm tired of the needles, the nodding off in the middle of traffic, the sight of small children sitting alone in a car for hours while their parents are utter zombies. FIX THAT SHIT.  BEFORE YOU GO AFTER MOTHER NATURE.","1","0.59"

"I've really suffered after moving from a place where I could legally access cannabis with a medical card to a place where it is criminalized and inaccessible. Additionally I no longer qualify for medicaid in this new state. Needless to say, my access to medical care and treatment has gone down considerably. Not only am I unable to get mental health care, I'm unable to properly self-medicate without legal dispensaries and strain specificity.    Criminalization of is a structural determinant of health. Given all the intersecting issues (mass incarceration, parental stress/child maltreatment, opioid epidemic) related to cannabis legalization, I think it's absurd that research is being limited on something with such incredible capacity to reduce health disparities. Legalizing cannabis would help individuals, families, communities, businesses, and health care systems. It's time for cannabis to be formally integrated into comprehensive, whole person health care.","1","0.59"

"I have mixed feeling about the legalization of cannabis. I think it should be used for medicinal purposes and that people who use it recreationally should use it responsibly.

"I think it should be legalized so the products can be regulated. Recreational users pretending to be medical patients have shifted the products available towards only high THC products and those aren't always the best products for medical patients. I rarely see products with known cannabinoids and terpenes that have been shown to reduce inflammation and nerve pain. I don't mind if they also use cannabis, but I would like to have more medicinal strains available and more consistency in the products. The wait times and process are also ridiculously long because of the additional people. If we are going to say it is a medicine it needs to be treated as one, but we can also acknowledge that some strains are more for recreational use and others are for medicinal use.   ","1","0.59"

"I think that it will help many people, and harm a few.  However, ultimately, individuals who are helped or harmed must take personal responsibility for their own decisions.  Just as there are people who misuse alcohol, there will be people who misuse pot.  I expect most of the people who misuse pot to fall in to one of two categories:  1. People who already misuse it.  2. People who already misuse other drugs (alcohol and prescriptions included)  If a large number of people get a quality of life improvement, at the expense of indulging people who are already using far more dangerous drugs, I see it as a net benefit.  State resources should be spent on education and rehabilitation, rather than a futile attempt at prohibition.","1","0.59"

This should be addressed and made right asap.","1","0.59"
