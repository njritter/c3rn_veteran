"100% agree in medical use, want to see it legal for medical at the Federal level.  If it is legal for recreational use, users need to be at least 25 as it seems to have negative side effects more on a developing brain.  It is a lot safer than alcohol, but especially with a younger brain, it is not innocuous. ","1","0.18"

"Do it. Cannabis is safer than alcohol, opioids and most otc or prescription drugs. Start researching this powerful medicine. People should be able to learn and experiment with varieties/methods and stock up when they find a particular batch that works. Obama Kush was the best medicine for my fibro and I wish I had bought a pound. I didn't realize it until I was too far away to get more. 2 different brands of Blue Dream from CO - 1 works, one doesn't. One has higher cbd, but neither has terpene test. Let's figure out why it works. Mn MM laws are too strict and varieties very limited. Whole plant medicine is not available.
