"• More and more people will use cannabis   • Cannibis legalization will usher in Americas new version of ""big tobacco""    • Prices of marijuana will increase and those who TRULY need it will suffer vs people who use it just to get high.   • Drug cartels and the black market will continue to function under the legalization of marijuana and will benefit.   • The number of fatal accidents with drivers testing positive for marijuana use has sky rocketed.     I am a medical marijuana patient, I do use it recreationally but it is going to do more harm then it does good and that is my personal opinion as well as factual studies that have proven legalization brings problems.

"As a medical patient I find access awesome but some of the dispensaries are more strict than others. SERA naturals for example is like fort nox and I feel as though I'm being treated like a criminal in there. Also, some of the workers at dispensaries (NETA) get personally offended if you don't like their product even if it is objectively not of good quality. It takes a bit to find places that have all around great quality products and selection. So far Revolutionary Clinics is my favorite but their edible selection isn't great.","1","0.14"

Cannabis has proven to be non addictive medicine that has been effective in pain therapy, muscle recovery, appetite stimulator, and in some lab tests eradicate cancer cells. The industry makers have made cannabis available in a true doseable form, therefore enabling an environment where doctors and patients can monitor and track the use of cannabis as a primary or supplemental medicine.

"Change the nomenclature, pot industry must rebrand if it ever wants to be truly legitimate. Keep recreational/medical separate units. I hope to god mj does not go down some big pharma path, but we must do something about the culture of weed (the names, the stereotypes) not overshadowing the medicinal benefits  that has helped countless people. I don't want to buy my cancer ridden grandma something called thunderfuck weed, can we call it like level 3, or chemo-easer or something not so blatant?! Also: DOJ-stay the FUCK out of this and go after the opioid crisis. I'm tired of seeing people OD on the street every single day.

"I've really suffered after moving from a place where I could legally access cannabis with a medical card to a place where it is criminalized and inaccessible. Additionally I no longer qualify for medicaid in this new state. Needless to say, my access to medical care and treatment has gone down considerably. Not only am I unable to get mental health care, I'm unable to properly self-medicate without legal dispensaries and strain specificity.    Criminalization of is a structural determinant of health. Given all the intersecting issues (mass incarceration, parental stress/child maltreatment, opioid epidemic) related to cannabis legalization, I think it's absurd that research is being limited on something with such incredible capacity to reduce health disparities. Legalizing cannabis would help individuals, families, communities, businesses, and health care systems. It's time for cannabis to be formally integrated into comprehensive, whole person health care.","1","0.14"

I rarely see products with known cannabinoids and terpenes that have been shown to reduce inflammation and nerve pain. I don't mind if they also use cannabis, but I would like to have more medicinal strains available and more consistency in the products. The wait times and process are also ridiculously long because of the additional people. If we are going to say it is a medicine it needs to be treated as one, but we can also acknowledge that some strains are more for recreational use and others are for medicinal use.   ","1","0.14"

Otherwise, your attempt at progression is futile. Also, advertising the differences between medical and recreational marijuana will be crucial. Other states have seen patterns of medical users turning their reliance solely to recreational dispensaries due to an ease of convenience - but is the weed the same? The benefits of legalization will be realized in time and I wonder in 15 years if legislators will look back and wonder why they didn't allow the ball to get rolling faster...maybe the other issues plaguing the state could've been solved via a tangential relationship we don't even understand yet.","1","0.14"

"Open Cannabis Consumer and Patient Survey 09/30/2018 Sunday 7:08pm    In 2014 we legalized consumption of cannabis in Oregon. We additionally tried to legalize a utopian bill in 2010 [I am pretty sure but it might have been 2012]. As a tree hugging Libertarian I fully endorse cannabis and hemp legalization on all levels.    Essentially I am a freedom fighter for those that believe that cannabis is a world/earth derived/plant based medicine/consumer product that should be provided by the farmers of the planet and should be legalized, not only nationally [the USof A] but by the world at large.    I apologize for acting like a US citizen [even though I am one], and the remarks that are created from that reality, but I also want you all to remember that these statements only come from being this free as a society that is this large.    Think about that, if you can.    Cannabis freedom will set the world on a new path.    Sincerely,  Nathaniel Grant Wygethrin [previously Nathaniel Wingate Grant]","1","0.14"

I can make wine, beer, spirits, even certain regulated chemicals or drugs, and they don't need to count my hops or limit the number of grape vines I have or raw products I can order, to still tax and regulate my finished product or crop. Its rediculous. People whose business plans are based on pre prohibition prices are rediculous too. Communities that opt out of voted for state measures are outright saying they prefer the black market to the legal one. Liscences are prohibitively expensive to small growers and anyone who hasn't been illegally profiting from selling volume, leaving it mostly full of outside investors who don't understand the plant or community, permits approved by committees full of corupt politicians... I could go on all day.","1","0.14"
"That the unintentional barriers that were put up in the legislation, that prohibits business from being created. first being in regards to community outreach. Before a business can be created they must go to the town and say how they will provide some type of community outreach by doing a service or some number of profits to this nonprofit organization. The cost of opening a cannabis business in MA is about $40,000 minimum. The cost than rise astronomically based on location testing cost for the rec. Or if you a potential cultivator it is maybe 45k total. When a normal small business costs 30k. (AARP) You than would need to ask a bank for a loan but none would give you the loans since they are still have to follow federal law. But than the town itself can charge a tax because you are growing, in addition to the state tax when you sell to a dispensary. So if all those criteria are met you than can maybe open up and you than need to get the towns approval by supporting a non-profit they like. It's not worth it to open up a business. So community outreach needs to be removed. This then is that even the labs that test for rec have to do this as well. ","1","0.14"

"The fact that it is not legal for consumption is insulting to every law-abiding adult who wants to use this plant. It is becoming ever-increasingly known that hypocrisy, misinformation, and prejudice were the driving factors behind the illegality surrounding this simple, ancient plant. If we expect to give any credence to the idea that we are enlightened and learned, then we must allow full legalization to happen. The current state of cannabis laws in this country (i.e. the fact that it is still referred to a marijuana, a word chosen to feed racist viewpoints, in law books) are appalling and shameful. Additionally, that the CCC is refusing to allow the adult-use market to open is unacceptable.
