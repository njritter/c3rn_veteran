"100% agree in medical use, want to see it legal for medical at the Federal level.

"• More and more people will use cannabis   • Cannibis legalization will usher in Americas new version of ""big tobacco""    • Prices of marijuana will increase and those who TRULY need it will suffer vs people who use it just to get high.   • Drug cartels and the black market will continue to function under the legalization of marijuana and will benefit.   • The number of fatal accidents with drivers testing positive for marijuana use has sky rocketed.     I am a medical marijuana patient, I do use it recreationally but it is going to do more harm then it does good and that is my personal opinion as well as factual studies that have proven legalization brings problems.

"As a medical patient I find access awesome but some of the dispensaries are more strict than others. SERA naturals for example is like fort nox and I feel as though I'm being treated like a criminal in there. Also, some of the workers at dispensaries (NETA) get personally offended if you don't like their product even if it is objectively not of good quality. It takes a bit to find places that have all around great quality products and selection. So far Revolutionary Clinics is my favorite but their edible selection isn't great.","1","0.12"

"As with any ingested substance that affects the body, there are risks for abuse and disuse, along with potential unintended social side effects, but when compared to other socially acceptable substances - notably alcohol - it is far less risky.  If nothing else, legalization should open up the doors for deep medical research which will hopefully provide effective alternatives to pharmaceuticals for many people.","1","0.12"

I don't want to buy my cancer ridden grandma something called thunderfuck weed, can we call it like level 3, or chemo-easer or something not so blatant?! Also: DOJ-stay the FUCK out of this and go after the opioid crisis. I'm tired of seeing people OD on the street every single day.

"I've really suffered after moving from a place where I could legally access cannabis with a medical card to a place where it is criminalized and inaccessible. Additionally I no longer qualify for medicaid in this new state. Needless to say, my access to medical care and treatment has gone down considerably. Not only am I unable to get mental health care, I'm unable to properly self-medicate without legal dispensaries and strain specificity.    Criminalization of is a structural determinant of health. Given all the intersecting issues (mass incarceration, parental stress/child maltreatment, opioid epidemic) related to cannabis legalization, I think it's absurd that research is being limited on something with such incredible capacity to reduce health disparities. Legalizing cannabis would help individuals, families, communities, businesses, and health care systems. It's time for cannabis to be formally integrated into comprehensive, whole person health care.","1","0.12"

I rarely see products with known cannabinoids and terpenes that have been shown to reduce inflammation and nerve pain. I don't mind if they also use cannabis, but I would like to have more medicinal strains available and more consistency in the products. The wait times and process are also ridiculously long because of the additional people. If we are going to say it is a medicine it needs to be treated as one, but we can also acknowledge that some strains are more for recreational use and others are for medicinal use.   ","1","0.12"

People who already misuse other drugs (alcohol and prescriptions included)  If a large number of people get a quality of life improvement, at the expense of indulging people who are already using far more dangerous drugs, I see it as a net benefit.

Before a business can be created they must go to the town and say how they will provide some type of community outreach by doing a service or some number of profits to this nonprofit organization. The cost of opening a cannabis business in MA is about $40,000 minimum. The cost than rise astronomically based on location testing cost for the rec. Or if you a potential cultivator it is maybe 45k total. When a normal small business costs 30k. (AARP) You than would need to ask a bank for a loan but none would give you the loans since they are still have to follow federal law. But than the town itself can charge a tax because you are growing, in addition to the state tax when you sell to a dispensary. So if all those criteria are met you than can maybe open up and you than need to get the towns approval by supporting a non-profit they like. It's not worth it to open up a business.
