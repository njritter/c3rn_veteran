"100% agree in medical use, want to see it legal for medical at the Federal level.  If it is legal for recreational use, users need to be at least 25 as it seems to have negative side effects more on a developing brain.  It is a lot safer than alcohol, but especially with a younger brain, it is not innocuous. ","1","0.41"

"As a medical patient I find access awesome but some of the dispensaries are more strict than others. SERA naturals for example is like fort nox and I feel as though I'm being treated like a criminal in there. Also, some of the workers at dispensaries (NETA) get personally offended if you don't like their product even if it is objectively not of good quality. It takes a bit to find places that have all around great quality products and selection. So far Revolutionary Clinics is my favorite but their edible selection isn't great.","1","0.41"
"As a Veteran with PTSD in a state where it isn't legal, I have to watch friends die due to opioid addictions rather than allow them to smoke a plant. Where is the logic in that? I don't smoke to get ""high"", I smoke to get ""normal"".  I am off of over 15 drugs with cannabis and I can be a father. Where on the ""legal"" drugs I was a zombie","1","0.41"

"I think it should be legalized so the products can be regulated. Recreational users pretending to be medical patients have shifted the products available towards only high THC products and those aren't always the best products for medical patients. I rarely see products with known cannabinoids and terpenes that have been shown to reduce inflammation and nerve pain. I don't mind if they also use cannabis, but I would like to have more medicinal strains available and more consistency in the products. The wait times and process are also ridiculously long because of the additional people. If we are going to say it is a medicine it needs to be treated as one, but we can also acknowledge that some strains are more for recreational use and others are for medicinal use.   ","1","0.41"

"It's insane that cannabis is illegal. Prohibition is a terrible policy for almost anything, but especially something that is either benign or beneficial as cannabis is. Legalization needs to happen so that innocent people stop being punished and so that use of a relatively harmless substance stops being a way for private prisons to profit off of what is essentially slave labor.     Not to mention giant pharmaceutical companies pushing meds, opioid epidemic destroying communities and fammilies, alcohol abuse affecting quality of life/public safety, etc. The list goes on forever and I'm sure you've heard it all.     Bottom line, cannabis should never have been outlawed and the fact that it can't even be studied is a travesty. ","1","0.41"

This should be addressed and made right asap.","1","0.41"
