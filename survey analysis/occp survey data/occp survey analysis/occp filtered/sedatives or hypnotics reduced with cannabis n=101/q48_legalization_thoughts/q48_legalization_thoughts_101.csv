"As a Veteran with PTSD in a state where it isn't legal, I have to watch friends die due to opioid addictions rather than allow them to smoke a plant. Where is the logic in that? I don't smoke to get ""high"", I smoke to get ""normal"".  I am off of over 15 drugs with cannabis and I can be a father. Where on the ""legal"" drugs I was a zombie","1","0.99"

"For me I'm a cannabis PT so I'm taking less medications and my lab work shows that my Kidney & Liver functions are in normal ranges after several years of going to Nephrologist and trying and changing meds to get my functions back under control. Give me cannabis take away the pills and the Nephrologist..my results are normal, I'm feeling healthier. Imagine that.. I feel also crime may be down, dealers maybe off the street less synthetic drugs , less deaths less ER visits less buses being used for senseless deaths or near deaths. I work in and Emergency Deptment we see what these other drugs do. Use to help get us out of the deficit,more and more people are smoking than drinking.  People smoke to much they get sleepy not fight, get mouthy create a seen.  Sell & tax it use the monies for the deficit, help the homeless, the sick, use for research Impeach Trump. ","1","0.99"

"I've really suffered after moving from a place where I could legally access cannabis with a medical card to a place where it is criminalized and inaccessible. Additionally I no longer qualify for medicaid in this new state. Needless to say, my access to medical care and treatment has gone down considerably. Not only am I unable to get mental health care, I'm unable to properly self-medicate without legal dispensaries and strain specificity.    Criminalization of is a structural determinant of health. Given all the intersecting issues (mass incarceration, parental stress/child maltreatment, opioid epidemic) related to cannabis legalization, I think it's absurd that research is being limited on something with such incredible capacity to reduce health disparities. Legalizing cannabis would help individuals, families, communities, businesses, and health care systems. It's time for cannabis to be formally integrated into comprehensive, whole person health care.","1","0.99"
"I am not in favor of recreational use of cannabis. I do believe in the medicinal use as patients under care of special Dr. Or clinic","1","0.99"
"I am pleased that its legal at the state level but It needs to be legal federally, just like alcohol and tobacco.  I am concerned about losing my job if tested randomly despite not being under the influence while at work. ","1","0.99"
"I am so grateful to have this available, I deal with a lot of anxiety and I do not like taking Clonozapam, or any other Chemical to help me with panic and anxiety attacks, with Cannabis I choose, how much to use, how the effects of being relaxed from a gumdrop, cookies, or flower at night, I dont have to settle myself down with half, or a full dose of a Chemical that is very, very sedating, no matter how much I take.

"I fully support full legalization. In Massachusetts, however, I have been disappointed with the stigma still attached despite being legal. This shows up in the form of barring cannabis users from using anywhere outside a private home and from growing “within view of others.” Legalization is great, the implementation isn’t always","1","0.99"

"I think it's important that it's done in a respectful and thoughtful way instead of becoming the next big capitalist machine, given the history of the plant I think that would be pretty upsetting.  And  I hope that legalizing cannabis will lead to people who were arrested because of the war on drugs being released from prison??","1","0.99"
"I think it is a Godsend to those who suffer and find out that it actually helps. It is a good thing. Hope the stigma from the past melts away. It's just another drug like any other in my opinion. I'm most for medical use. But recreational use is ok I guess. Make it legal. Have laws/legal age/id, etc. and enforce it like any other legal drug.","1","0.99"

"Recreational legal cannabis is appropriate. Medical should remain a separate category, to allow regulations that increase access to cannabis products for disabled and low income people. Higher plant allowances for patients growing, continuous supply at dispensaries, paying no tax, discounts for those on Medicare, Medicaid, or other financial assistances are all appropriate. The certification and card system for medical should be free; subsidized by the taxes on recreational cannabis.","1","0.99"

"Sometimes I feel in the years ahead that the use of marijuana now will cause great health problems like the tobacco industry did. All though it helps now with many health problems my concern is not knowing the future problems it may bring and what’s being hidden from the public in order to bring high sales in. I also feel that ALL health insurances should cover the use of medical marijuana as a medication. especially if medical marijuana in that particular state is legal.","1","0.99"

"They need to legalize totally. Make it simple, you have to be 21 in order to grow, buy, manufacture,any cannabis. Simple. Treat like alcohol. They need to subsidize the cost for the medical patients who can't afford. Just like ""legit"" drugs.","1","0.99"

"Until concentrates are introduced (Canada) I will not be participating in the legal market. I rely on concentrates to treat my PTSD and cannot smoke flower due to asthma. Vaping concentrates is much easier on my lungs and the effects on my mood are instantaneous, with flower I would need to smoke more than one hit to feel anywhere near the same as a single 0.05g~ dab of a concentrate.","1","0.99"
