"Did you ask about terpene testing or was I just on my soapbox? If you want to gather more good information, add more fill-in boxes. ie. #53-54. I used recreationally when younger, but not much at all as a parent. Then I 'recreated' one evening after developing fibromyalgia and realized this is medicine! Now I use medicinally, and recreate on the occasional weekend. Much prefer cannabis to alcohol. I've done a lot of research & experimentation on it, and enjoy sharing that knowledge with friends and family. Taught a mature friend to smoke for the first time in her life. She now legally consumes regularly to significantly improve her fibro symptoms so she can keep working.
