"100% agree in medical use, want to see it legal for medical at the Federal level.  If it is legal for recreational use, users need to be at least 25 as it seems to have negative side effects more on a developing brain.  It is a lot safer than alcohol, but especially with a younger brain, it is not innocuous. ","1","0.45"

"As a medical patient I find access awesome but some of the dispensaries are more strict than others. SERA naturals for example is like fort nox and I feel as though I'm being treated like a criminal in there. Also, some of the workers at dispensaries (NETA) get personally offended if you don't like their product even if it is objectively not of good quality. It takes a bit to find places that have all around great quality products and selection. So far Revolutionary Clinics is my favorite but their edible selection isn't great.","1","0.45"
"As a Veteran with PTSD in a state where it isn't legal, I have to watch friends die due to opioid addictions rather than allow them to smoke a plant. Where is the logic in that? I don't smoke to get ""high"", I smoke to get ""normal"".  I am off of over 15 drugs with cannabis and I can be a father. Where on the ""legal"" drugs I was a zombie","1","0.45"

It has helped me so much have a life I can finally live. It should be legalized, however it should also be regulated. To many companies out there trying to jump on the train when their products are crap. I get my oil from a reputable company no fillers CO2 processing and FDA approved facility.

"Do it. Cannabis is safer than alcohol, opioids and most otc or prescription drugs. Start researching this powerful medicine. People should be able to learn and experiment with varieties/methods and stock up when they find a particular batch that works. Obama Kush was the best medicine for my fibro and I wish I had bought a pound. I didn't realize it until I was too far away to get more. 2 different brands of Blue Dream from CO - 1 works, one doesn't. One has higher cbd, but neither has terpene test. Let's figure out why it works. Mn MM laws are too strict and varieties very limited. Whole plant medicine is not available. Have to spend a lot of $ to certify to see if one of the few products works.","1","0.45"

I feel also crime may be down, dealers maybe off the street less synthetic drugs , less deaths less ER visits less buses being used for senseless deaths or near deaths. I work in and Emergency Deptment we see what these other drugs do. Use to help get us out of the deficit,more and more people are smoking than drinking.  People smoke to much they get sleepy not fight, get mouthy create a seen.  Sell & tax it use the monies for the deficit, help the homeless, the sick, use for research Impeach Trump. ","1","0.45"

Many, many people have been exposed to the criminal justice system who shouldn't have been. Cannabis appears to help many problems that develop as people age, often better than prescription medicine.

Its rediculous. People whose business plans are based on pre prohibition prices are rediculous too. Communities that opt out of voted for state measures are outright saying they prefer the black market to the legal one. Liscences are prohibitively expensive to small growers and anyone who hasn't been illegally profiting from selling volume, leaving it mostly full of outside investors who don't understand the plant or community, permits approved by committees full of corupt politicians...
