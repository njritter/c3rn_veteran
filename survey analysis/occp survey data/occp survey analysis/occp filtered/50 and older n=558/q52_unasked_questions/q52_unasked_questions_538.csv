"Are you using cannabis to seek relief without a high?  Or, do you have to be high to achieve medical relief?  Or, how important is getting relief without a high to you?  The dosing question should separate THC amount from CBD amount because the total number of cannabinoids is misleading. For example, my daily use is 100mg total, 80CBD 20THC. This put me in high usage category but I don't get high.   A question on how knowledgable friends and family are about cannabis would give a broader understanding of market knowledge.   Where would you prefer to gain knowledge about cannabis could reveal a need for unrealized sources?  Asking more specific questions on pricing of products would reveal the how wide the price range is in the market, i.e. price per mg of each method used. ","1","0.19"

"Did you ask about terpene testing or was I just on my soapbox? If you want to gather more good information, add more fill-in boxes. ie. #53-54. I used recreationally when younger, but not much at all as a parent. Then I 'recreated' one evening after developing fibromyalgia and realized this is medicine! Now I use medicinally, and recreate on the occasional weekend. Much prefer cannabis to alcohol. I've done a lot of research & experimentation on it, and enjoy sharing that knowledge with friends and family. Taught a mature friend to smoke for the first time in her life.
