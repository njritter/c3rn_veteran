"Cannabis should be legal.  If you don't like it, don't use it.","1","1.3"
"Cannabis should be reclassed as a schedule 1 drug given the genetic research that has gone into the cannabis plant and ability to identify and measure the effects of each individual chemical compound within the plants makeup. Cannabis has proven to be non addictive medicine that has been effective in pain therapy, muscle recovery, appetite stimulator, and in some lab tests eradicate cancer cells. The industry makers have made cannabis available in a true doseable form, therefore enabling an environment where doctors and patients can monitor and track the use of cannabis as a primary or supplemental medicine. Cannabis is now being coined the ""exit drug"" and could have a significant, positive impact on the nations current opioid crisis. ","1","1.3"

"Federal government needs to legalize marijuana. Get on the same page as the rest of the states.","1","1.3"
"FINALLY!! I can't wait until it's federally legal. It's ridiculous to forbid a harmless plant with so many benefits. ","1","1.3"
"Fine with it","1","1.3"
"For medical purpose,i'm all for it.Age limit maybe..doctors need more education...","1","1.3"
"Hope that the entire USA is legitimized.  Difficult to travel as some states will arrest you if you are traveling thru....annoying and medically not appropriate for those of us who need our medical marijuana","1","1.3"
"I'm all for it. I'm heavily invested in both the Canadian and US sector. I preach to everyone around my about it. Legalization should have happened decades ago and the fact that it took so long is ridiculous.","1","1.3"
"I am extremely pleased that cannabis has been legalized.","1","1.3"
"I am pleased that its legal at the state level but It needs to be legal federally, just like alcohol and tobacco.  I am concerned about losing my job if tested randomly despite not being under the influence while at work. ","1","1.3"
"I am very pro legalization!","1","1.3"
"I believe it should be 100% legal and regulated like alcohol, and everybody should be allowed to grow their own.","1","1.3"
"I believe most states are moving in the right direction in regards to cannabis, however the efforts will be for nothing if the federal government doesn’t legalize on the federal level.","1","1.3"

"I think it's long overdue and hope the government or corporations do not screw it up. I also hope prices come down a little. I hate to have to choose between sleep/pain or spending too much.","1","1.3"
"I think that it will help many people, and harm a few.  However, ultimately, individuals who are helped or harmed must take personal responsibility for their own decisions.  Just as there are people who misuse alcohol, there will be people who misuse pot.  I expect most of the people who misuse pot to fall in to one of two categories:  1. People who already misuse it.  2. People who already misuse other drugs (alcohol and prescriptions included)  If a large number of people get a quality of life improvement, at the expense of indulging people who are already using far more dangerous drugs, I see it as a net benefit.  State resources should be spent on education and rehabilitation, rather than a futile attempt at prohibition.","1","1.3"
"I worry that rec use could increase use by children and others who will not use it responsibly. ","1","1.3"
"I’m in favor","1","1.3"
"I’m in full support of it. If we can legalize alcohol and tobacco, both substances with lots of dangerous side effects, then we can legalize cannabis which has few negative side effects","1","1.3"

"It's been a long time coming","1","1.3"
"It has been an absolute travesty that such a beneficial plant has been so unjustly demonized by our government. The American Public deserves an official government apology and correction for the ""fake news"" that they have created and diseminated since 1937. Cannabis should be immediately re-scheduled, studied for its yet to to be fully determined benefits and legalized for consumption for anyone over the age of 21.  ","1","1.3"

"Should be legal for medical use everywhere in this country. ","1","1.3"
"Should be legal in the USA","1","1.3"
"Should be legal to use/grow a plant. Medical use demonstrates that Cannabis should not be a Schedule 1 drug. Only because big Pharma would loose billions in revenue of not stigmatized as dangerous. Safer than OTC's, no one has died from overdose, better than pain pills.","1","1.3"
