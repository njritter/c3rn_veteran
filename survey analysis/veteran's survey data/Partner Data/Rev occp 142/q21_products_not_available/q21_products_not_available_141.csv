"The problem with dispensaries is that you find a strain that works and then it's gone. It may come back months later, but uneven supplies is endemic to ALL dispensaries. Also, I very much like Gorilla Glue for its sativa qualities, but some dispensaries seem to have turned it into more of an indica (albeit under the name ""GG#4"")","1","0.71"
